# HackPrinceton-Scraper
-----------------------
Scraper for the HackPrinceton website


The goal of this assignment is to build a Python scraper for the HackPrinceton 2016 website.  
In the first part, you will create a parser for the submissions of the hackathon and answer some questions through coding exercises.  
In the second part, you will deal with parsing all of the participants of the hackathon.  


## Requirements
As described above, this assignment will be coded in Python.  
Therefore, you will need a working version of Python.  
We highly recommend you use version 2.7, but version 3.x will work as well.  

You will be using two third-party librairies to build the scrapers:
* `requests` :  used to perform HTTP requests and easily handle the responses.  

* `lxml` : used to parse HTML code.
